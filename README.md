# Simple Crypto Indexer

Welcome to my Simple Crypto Indexer! This project is a straightforward web application built using JavaScript and the React framework. Its primary purpose is to provide users with an easy way to search for information on various cryptocurrencies. With this web app, you can quickly look up details about your favorite cryptocurrencies, including their own website, their current price, market cap, volume, and more.

I know this app is quite simple to make, but the main purpose for creating it was learning more about the React framework, to consolidate my knowledge in the frontend field and to build more performing and attractive dApps on Ethereum in the future.
